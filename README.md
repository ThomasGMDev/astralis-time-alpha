# astralis-time-alpha

This project is a personal hobby of mine, so performance optimization isn't the focus here.
Lots of things could be improved right now but I'm not focusing on that since I do not need to do so.

There are many libraries and dependencies used in this project.
Needed packages: ytdl-core, youtube-search, yt-search, hltv, discord.js and ffmpeg.

The BOT is up 24/7 as I deployed it using Heroku, so a Procfile is needed for that.
